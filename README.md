# 1971-and-all-that
2021 marks the 50th anniversary of women’s suffrage in Switzerland: a perfect opportunity to investigate what led to the events in 1971 and what happened since then. 

We will focus on the discourse around women, feminism and women’s right to vote in Switzerland by analysing relevant newspaper articles. Our aim is to apply natural language processing methods on those texts that are accessible via the [impresso app](https://impresso-project.ch/app/). This app - product of an [SNF funded project](https://impresso-project.ch/) - contains digitised articles of newspapers from 1740 to 2000. It mainly features historical newspaper collections, but also the archives of Le Temps and the Neue Zürcher Zeitung. 

In this corpus we want to identify those characteristic topics that are related to women’s suffrage in Switzerland. As a result, we would like to produce a timeline that allows to visualise how these topics developed over time.
